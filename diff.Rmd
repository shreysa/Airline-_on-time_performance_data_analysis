Assignment A4 was done as part of assignment A8. Below are the changes I made to the assignment:

A4                                                               | A8
-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------
The initial code had 3 Map and 2 reduce jobs and 1 reduce job    | There is just 1 Map reduce job 

The 1st mapper and reducer would just do the cleaning part       | The Mapper cleans and and maps the airport and airlines data

The 2nd map job maps mean delay data for airlines                | The reducer calculates the mean delay for each
The 3rd map job maps mean delay data for airports                | The output is merged file with mean delays for airport & airlines airlines
The 2nd reduce job generates the actual mean delay and dump it into|                                     
2 seperate files (1 for airline and 1 for airport)     |
